    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: December 6, 2025</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Privacy First:</strong> Whatsapp Research is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any *personally identifiable* information. All calculations are performed locally on your device. We do, however, use anonymized usage data through Google Analytics to improve the app's performance and user experience.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to whatsapp-research("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our **PopSync Live World Population** mobile application (the "App") and its associated website. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII). Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names or contact information</li>
        <li>Email addresses or phone numbers</li>
        <li>Location data that can identify you</li>
        <li>Device identifiers directly linked to your identity</li>
        <li>Any personal input data (as the app is a live counter and collects no user input)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 User Input Data</h3>
    <p>The App is a Search keywords in your WhatsApp chat history and **does not require or collect any user-input data** (such as name, weight, height, etc.). The app functions purely by displaying publicly available statistical data.</p>
    
    <h3>2.3 Technical Information for App Functionality</h3>
    <p>We may collect minimal, anonymized technical information for app functionality and improvement purposes, which does not identify you personally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App version number</li>
        <li>Device operating system version (for compatibility)</li>
        <li>Crash reports (if you opt-in to share them through your device's settings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used solely to improve app performance and fix bugs.</p>
    <h3>2.4 Analytics and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We use Google Analytics to understand how users interact with our App and its associated website (<a href="https://pop2sync.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pop2sync.web.app/</a>). Google Analytics collects non-personally identifiable information such as your device's anonymized IP address, device type, operating system, browser type, pages viewed, time spent on pages, and referring URLs. This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.</p>
    <p>We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movements around the site, and gather broad demographic information about our user base as a whole. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>You can learn more about how Google uses data when you use our App/site here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>. You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

    

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Any data that could be locally stored by the App (such as settings) will be removed when you uninstall the App. We do not have servers that store user data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> share your personal user data with third parties because we do not collect or store it. We use Google Analytics as a third-party service provider to process anonymized usage data (as described in section 2.4) to help us understand app and website usage. Google processes this data on our behalf, in compliance with their privacy policies.</p>
    <p>Beyond Google Analytics for anonymized usage data, we do not use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>
        <li>Social media integrations for data collection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect any personally identifiable information, there is no special concern regarding children's data. However, we recommend that children use the App under parental supervision.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>Since all app data processing happens on your device and we do not transmit or store any personal information, the security of your data is primarily dependent on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>

        <li>Using device lock features (PIN, password, biometric)</li>
        <li>Only downloading apps from official app stores</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding anonymized usage data collected by Google Analytics, Google employs robust security measures to protect that data.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, most data protection rights don't apply to such data from our end. However, you always have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the App anonymously</li>
        <li>Delete the App and all associated local data at any time</li>
        <li>Opt-out of Google Analytics tracking (see section 2.4)</li>
        <li>Contact us with privacy concerns</li>
        <li>Request information about our privacy practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
    <p>This App can be used worldwide. Since app data processing happens locally on your device, international data transfer regulations don't apply to it. Anonymized usage data collected by Google Analytics may be transferred and processed in various countries, including the United States, in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>12. Open Source and Transparency</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>No hidden personal data collection occurs</li>
        <li>All statistical data processing is done locally</li>
        <li>Users can verify our privacy claims</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
